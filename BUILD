You need cmake.

> make build
> cd build
> cmake ..
> make

You obtains libjps.so and example.
You need to copy libjps.so in /lib, /usr/lib, or somethink like that place.

> sudo make install
This will copy libjps.so in /usr/local/lib.

If you don’t want to install libjps.so, you can use it in place by setting the
LD_LIBRARY_PATH to the build directory.
> export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/…/jps/build/

You can test your installation by running example
> ./example
(3, 3) -> (4, 2) -> (20, 2) -> (21, 3) -> (23, 3) -> (25, 5)
